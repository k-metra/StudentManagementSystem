Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to allow others to view, share, and distribute the Work 
freely, so long as the original creator is credited, the work is not used 
for commercial purposes, and no modifications or derivative works are made.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, the person associating 
CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 with a Work (the "Licensor") offers the Work under the 
terms set forth below.

1. License

  a. Use the Work for commercial purposes;
  b. Modify, adapt, or create derivative works of the Work;
  c. Sublicense the Work or apply additional restrictions;
  d. Remove, obscure, or alter any credit, copyright, or attribution 
     notice as provided by the Licensor.

2. Attribution

You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and 
indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, 
but not in any way that suggests the Licensor endorses you or your use.

3. NonCommercial

You may not use the Work for commercial purposes. A commercial use is one 
primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary 
compensation.

4. NoDerivatives

If you remix, transform, or build upon the Work, you may not distribute 
the modified material.

You may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally 
restrict others from doing anything the license permits.

     surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
  b. The Work is offered as-is and as-available, and the Licensor makes no

     non-infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy,
     or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all
     to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
  c. Licensor disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons 
     that may apply to the Work or any use thereof. Further, Licensor 
     disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents,
